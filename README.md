#Project Title: Medical Vial Defect Detection using K-Means Clustering

#Description:
This project focuses on the detection of defects in medical vial bottles using K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The system is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, providing an interactive and easily accessible environment for defect analysis.

#Key Features:
1. Defect Identification: Utilizing K-Means Clustering, the system efficiently identifies and classifies defects in medical vial images, including damage, cracks, air bubbles, and other anomalies.

2. Image Processing: The notebook incorporates image processing techniques to preprocess and enhance medical vial images, optimizing them for effective defect detection.

3. Algorithm Implementation: The K-Means algorithm is applied to segment images and cluster pixels, aiding in the localization and classification of defects within the medical vials.

4. Visualizations: The project includes visualizations to showcase the segmented regions and clusters, providing insights into the distribution of defects across the vial images.

5. Notebook Interactivity: The Jupyter notebook format allows for an interactive exploration of the defect detection process, enabling users to modify parameters and observe the impact on results.

#How it Works:
1. Data Preparation: Upload medical vial images to the notebook for analysis.

2. Image Preprocessing: Apply preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality and facilitate effective defect detection.

3. K-Means Clustering: Implement the K-Means algorithm to cluster pixels and identify regions with potential defects.

4. Defect Localization: Visualize and analyze segmented regions to identify and locate defects within the medical vials.

5. Iterative Analysis: Utilize the interactive nature of the notebook to fine-tune parameters, observe results, and enhance defect detection accuracy.

#Why Choose this Notebook:
- Ease of Use: The Jupyter notebook format provides a user-friendly and interactive platform for defect analysis without the need for additional UI components.

- Educational: Serve as a valuable educational resource for understanding the application of K-Means Clustering in image analysis and defect detection.

- Flexibility: Users can easily modify and experiment with the notebook, adapting it to different datasets and scenarios.
